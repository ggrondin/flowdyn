# TODO list

## future developments

- iterative solvers for linear system in implicit solvers
- adaptive time stepping
- compute and store residual history

## known limitations / enhancements

- [x] stop integration with max number of iteration criterion
- [ ] stop integration with residual criterion
- [x] stop integration with total cpu time

## documentation

- `integration` subpackage: description of all methods

## package structure

- remove `mesh` dependency in integration methods initialization
